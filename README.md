<h2>Projects:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Car Insurance</li>
    <li>Twenty One</li>

  </ul>
  
  <h3>Car Insurance</h3>
  This project is an MVC web application. It takes the user's input on policy information and calculates a quote based on business logic. There is also an admin page which allows the staff to view all of the quotes which have been issued.
  
 <h3>Twenty One</h3>
 This project simulates a game of BlackJack. It includes the user's name as well as keeping track of the bet and banks amounts. The program shuffles, acts as a dealer, and accounts for exceptions.
  
  <h3>Newsletter MVC</h3>
  This project is an MVC web application. It takes user input and saves to a database. It also allows users to unsubscribe.
